Hello, Thanks for the draft. The right content seems to be there, but we've got some additional thoughts on how things should look. One of the parents is a graphic designer. She took a look at the pages you sent, and came up with the two attached design alternatives. 

We want you to decide which one looks better. 

On the other hand, I would like you to propose another design to us, different from these two that I am sending you.

So I expect you to send me two resulting designs (the Designer's and your own!).Thanks, 

BTW, Iâ€™ve also attached additional images that are referenced in the two designs that she created in case they are useful to you. 

Thanks, 

Tom Denton
